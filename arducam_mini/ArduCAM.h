  ArduCAM.h - Arduino library support for CMOS Image Sensor
  Copyright (C)2011-2015 ArduCAM.com. All right reserved

  Basic functionality of this library are based on the demo-code provided by
  ArduCAM.com. You can find the latest version of the library at
  http://www.ArduCAM.com

  Now supported controllers:
		- OV7670
		- MT9D111
		- OV7675
		- OV2640
		- OV3640
		- OV5642
		- OV5640
		- OV7660
		- OV7725
		- MT9M112
		- MT9V111
		- OV5640
		- MT9M001
		- MT9T112
		- MT9D112

	We will add support for many other sensors in next release.

  Supported MCU platform
		-	Theoretically support all Arduino families
		-	Arduino UNO R3			(Tested)
		-	Arduino MEGA2560 R3		(Tested)
		-	Arduino Leonardo R3		(Tested)
		-	Arduino Nano			(Tested)
		-	Arduino DUE				(Tested)
		- 	Arduino Yun				(Tested)
		-	Raspberry Pi			(Tested)
		- 	ESP8266-12				(Tested)
		* 	Feather M0                (Tested with OV5642)

  If you make any modifications or improvements to the code, I would appreciate
  that you share the code with me so that I might include it in the next release.
